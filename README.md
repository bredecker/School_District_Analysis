# School_District_Analysis

##Project Overview
Our client Maria has received a new version of student data that has added an additional column to add "school budget" to the dataframe. 

1. Collect student data into a new dataframe (student_df). 
2. Clean up the collected version of new data. 
3. Summarize key pieces of data, such as "school type", "average reading scores for combined grades", and "total students per school". 
4. Analysize specfic subsets of data, such as reading scores for 10th graders at Dixon High School. 
5. Compare data by sorting values in descending order to identify any trends or patterns. 

##Resources
Software: Python
Data Source: new_full_student_data.csv

##Summary and Overview
By cleaning the data and sorting it in a more readable fashion, it allows the client to see the correlation between school budgets and the effect it has on student performance reflected in their math and reading scores. This should allow them to allocate budgetary resources to those areas that need it most.
